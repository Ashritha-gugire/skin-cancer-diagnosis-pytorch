## Image processing algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for the classification of skin lesions, with the ultimate objective of diagnosing various skin conditions. 
Key aspects of the project include:

1.Utilizing a dataset that includes patient/demographic details such as gender, age, lesion location on the body, along with images and lesion IDs.
2.Data preprocessing and exploration, including filtering image files based on file extension and mapping lesion types to their corresponding categories for analysis and model training.
3.Implementing a pretrained ResNetX101 model with data augmentation techniques to improve robustness and avoid overfitting.
4.Dividing the dataset into validation and training sets to assess model performance.
5.Tracking metrics like training loss and validation accuracy during the training phase.
6.Achieving improved accuracy and decreasing loss over epochs.

# Introduction
This project aims to develop an image processing algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify specific types of skin cancer from clinical images. Utilizing a ResNetX101 architecture, the model classifies skin lesions into seven categories: Melanoma, Melanocytic nevus, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic keratosis, Benign keratosis, Vascular lesions, and Dermatofibroma.

### Research Question
This project is part of a broader research initiative addressing the question:
"How can the applications of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in the analysis of genomic data enhance our capacity to detect dynamic gene expression patterns linked to cancer progression, and what valuable insights can be gleaned from these HMM-based analyses regarding the genetic mechanisms driving cancer development?"

While our current project focuses on image-based diagnosis using CNNs, future work may incorporate HMM-based analysis of genomic data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of skin cancer progression and development.

### Motivation
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, with a significant impact on global health. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project seeks to aid medical professionals in diagnosing skin cancer by leveraging deep learning techniques, potentially reducing diagnostic errors and improving patient outcomes.
The increasing prevalence of genetically inherited diseases necessitates sophisticated genetic data analysis. By combining image-based diagnosis with genomic data analysis, we aim to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of skin cancer and other genetically transmitted diseases.
